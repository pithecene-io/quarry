/**
 * Child process fixture for resolve-from integration test.
 *
 * Exercises the ESM resolve hook end-to-end using the production
 * registerResolveFromHook function (not a copy):
 * 1. Reads QUARRY_RESOLVE_FROM from env (set by parent test)
 * 2. Calls registerResolveFromHook() — same code path as bin/executor.ts
 * 3. Dynamically imports a bare specifier ("@test/greet") that only
 *    exists under the QUARRY_RESOLVE_FROM directory
 * 4. Writes the resolved value to stdout
 *
 * The parent test creates the fake package, spawns this fixture, and
 * asserts that the import succeeds and uses ESM import conditions.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 = import succeeded via fallback
 *   1 = import failed (hook didn't work)
 *   2 = QUARRY_RESOLVE_FROM not set
 */
