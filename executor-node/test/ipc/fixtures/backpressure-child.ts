/**
 * Child process fixture for backpressure integration test.
 *
 * Installs the stdout guard, creates a StdioSink with an instrumented
 * writeFn that counts backpressure events (write returning false), and
 * writes ~400KB of IPC frames — enough to exceed the OS pipe buffer
 * (~64KB) plus Node's internal Writable buffer (~64KB highWaterMark),
 * totaling ~180KB capacity before write() returns false.
 *
 * The parent test withholds reading from stdout until it receives the
 * 'BP' signal on stderr, ensuring the pipe is truly full.
 *
 * Signals:
 * - 'BP' on stderr: emitted immediately when write() first returns false.
 *   Tells the parent the pipe is full and the child is blocked on drain.
 * - 'backpressure_events=N' on stderr: final count, emitted after all
 *   writes complete, for the parent to assert N > 0.
 *
 * If the drain event is not delivered (the bug this test pins), the child
 * will hang indefinitely and the parent test's timeout will catch it.
