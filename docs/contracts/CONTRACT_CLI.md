# Quarry CLI Contract

This document freezes the **CLI surface** and **read-only guarantees** for
Quarry. It defines the command topology, required invariants, and the
request/response shapes exposed by the runtime.

This is a contract document. Implementations must conform.

---

## Scope

- Defines CLI invariants and non-goals.
- Defines command topology and required subcommands.
- Defines output format selection and rendering rules.
- Defines request/response shapes for CLI-visible operations.

Non-goals:
- Does not define executor behavior.
- Does not define ingestion policy implementation details.
- Does not define storage layouts (see CONTRACT_LODE.md).

---

## Invariants

- The CLI is the **only execution entrypoint**.
- All commands except `run` are **read-only** with respect to execution,
  datasets, and persisted state.
- A small set of `debug` commands may mutate **ephemeral runtime mechanics**
  only when explicitly requested and documented.
- The CLI talks **only** to the Go runtime.
- The executor never exposes CLI surfaces.
- No command starts a long-running background process.
- No scheduler or control-plane commands are permitted.

---

```

Forbidden commands:
- `status`

- `control`
- `serve`

---

## Output and Rendering

All `inspect`, `stats`, and `list` commands share the same output contract.

### Supported Formats

- `json` (canonical, stable)
- `table` (human-readable)
- `yaml` (debugging and config inspection)

### Format Selection Rules

- If output is a TTY, default to `table`.
- If output is not a TTY, default to `json`.
- A user-specified `--format` always overrides defaults.
- Invalid formats are errors.

### Shared Flags

- `--format=json|table|yaml`
- `--no-color` (affects table output only, not TUI)
- `--tui` (inspect and stats commands only)

Rendering is centralized. Command handlers must not implement custom
formatting logic.

### TUI Mode

TUI mode (`--tui`) provides interactive views for select read-only commands.

**TUI Policy:**

- **Opt-in only**: TUI is never the default. Users must explicitly request it.
- **Read-only only**: TUI is only available for `inspect` and `stats` commands.
- **Same data payloads**: TUI renders the same data structures as non-TUI output.
  There is no TUI-exclusive data.
- **Presentation only**: Bubble Tea is a presentation layer. It does not fetch
  additional data or perform mutations.
- **Clean exit**: TUI must exit cleanly on `q` or `Ctrl+C`.

Commands that do not support TUI must error if `--tui` is provided.

Supported TUI commands:
- `inspect run|job|task|proxy|executor`
- `stats runs|jobs|tasks|proxies|executors|metrics`

Unsupported (must error with `--tui`):
- `list` commands
- `debug` commands
- `version`
- `run`

---

## `run` (execution)

`quarry run` is the **only** command that executes work.
It must conform to CONTRACT_RUN.md and emit observability defined by
CONTRACT_EMIT.md and CONTRACT_POLICY.md.

No other command may initiate or control execution.

### Exit Codes

The `run` command exit code is determined by execution outcome:

| Exit Code | OutcomeStatus | Meaning |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 0 | `success` | Run completed successfully |
| 1 | `script_error` | Script emitted `run_error` |
| 2 | `executor_crash` | Executor crashed or exited abnormally |
| 3 | `policy_failure` | Ingestion policy failed (non-retryable) |
| 3 | `version_mismatch` | SDK/CLI contract version mismatch (non-retryable) |

`policy_failure` and `version_mismatch` share exit code 3 because both
are non-retryable configuration errors that cannot be resolved by re-running.

### Streaming Policy Flags (v0.7.0+)

`quarry run` supports a `streaming` ingestion policy with configurable flush
triggers. At least one of `--flush-count` or `--flush-interval` must be
specified when `--policy=streaming`.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--flush-count` | int | | Flush after N events accumulate |
| `--flush-interval` | duration | | Flush every T duration (e.g. `5s`, `30s`) |

Semantics:
- Both may be specified; the first trigger to fire wins.
- Buffer is bounded internally; if full before a trigger fires, ingestion
  blocks until the next flush (events are never dropped).
- On run termination, a final flush is always attempted (best effort).
- Flush trigger counts are surfaced in `stats metrics` (see CONTRACT_METRICS.md).

### Adapter Flags (v0.5.0+)

`quarry run` supports optional event-bus adapter notification.
See CONTRACT_INTEGRATION.md for semantics.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--adapter` | string | | Adapter type (`webhook`, `redis`) |
| `--adapter-url` | string | | Endpoint URL (required when `--adapter` set) |
| `--adapter-header` | string (repeatable) | | Custom header as `key=value` (webhook only) |
| `--adapter-channel` | string | | Pub/sub channel name (redis only, default `quarry:run_completed`) |
| `--adapter-timeout` | duration | `10s` | Per-request timeout |
| `--adapter-retries` | int | `3` | Retry attempts |

Adapter invocation is best-effort. Failures are logged to stderr.
The run exit code is determined by execution outcome, never by adapter status.

### Fan-Out Flags (v0.6.0+)

`quarry run` supports optional derived work execution via enqueue events.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--depth` | int | `0` | Max fan-out recursion depth (0 = disabled) |
| `--max-runs` | int | | Total child run cap (required when `--depth > 0`) |
| `--parallel` | int | `1` | Max concurrent child runs |

Semantics:
- `--depth 0` (default): enqueue events are advisory only; no child runs.
- `--depth > 0`: enqueue events trigger child runs up to the specified depth.
- `--max-runs` is mandatory when `--depth > 0` (safety rail).
- `--parallel > 1` without `--depth > 0` emits a stderr warning (no-op).
- Deduplication: identical `(target, params)` pairs are executed once.
- Exit code is determined by root run outcome only.
- Child run results appear in the fan-out summary printed to stdout.
- Child runs inherit the root run's `--source` and `--category` by default.
  Per-child overrides are supported via `emit.enqueue({ source, category })`.
- `target` is resolved as a file path relative to CWD (same as `--script`).
  Target resolution semantics may change; do not depend on path resolution details.

**Caveats:**
- `storage.put()` in child scripts requires that storage is properly configured
  on the root run. A missing FileWriter will fail the child run immediately.
- Per-enqueue `source`/`category` overrides apply to the immediate child only;
  grandchildren inherit from their parent unless they also specify overrides.

### Config File (v0.4.x+)

`quarry run` supports an optional `--config <path>` flag that loads a YAML
config file providing project-level defaults for run flags.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--config` | string | | Path to YAML config file |

**Precedence rules:**
1. CLI flags (explicitly set) always win.
2. Config file values are used if the CLI flag was not explicitly set.
3. urfave flag defaults apply if neither CLI nor config provides a value.

**Required field handling:**
- `--source`, `--storage-backend`, and `--storage-path` are no longer
  `Required` on the flag definition. They are validated after config merge.
  If missing from both CLI and config, an actionable error is returned.
- `--script` and `--run-id` remain `Required: true` (per-invocation, never
  in config).

**Proxy pool migration:**
- Proxy pools may be defined inline under `proxies:` in the config file,
  replacing the need for a separate `--proxy-config` JSON file.
- `--proxy-config` and config `proxies:` cannot both be present (config error).
- `--proxy-config` used alone still works but emits a deprecation warning.

**No auto-discovery:** Config files are loaded only via explicit `--config`.
There is no implicit `quarry.yaml` search in the working directory.

### Transparent Browser Reuse (v0.7.2+)

By default, `quarry run` transparently reuses a Chromium browser process
across sequential invocations. The browser is launched as a detached process
on the first run and self-terminates after an idle timeout (default: 60s).

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--no-browser-reuse` | bool | `false` | Disable browser reuse (per-run browser) |

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `QUARRY_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Idle timeout in seconds before browser self-terminates |

**Semantics:**
- The browser server is a **transparent optimization**, analogous to
  `git credential-cache`. It self-terminates and requires no user management.
- `--browser-ws-endpoint` (explicit) takes absolute priority. Browser reuse
  is bypassed entirely when set.
- Fan-out (`--depth > 0`) uses the reusable browser if available; falls back
  to `LaunchManagedBrowser` when reuse is disabled.
- Proxy mismatch between runs causes a graceful fallback to per-run browser
  launch (the reusable browser is not killed).
- Discovery state is stored in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/quarry/browser.json`
  (or `$TMPDIR/quarry-$UID/` on macOS). Concurrent access is serialized
  via `flock`.
- Config file: `no_browser_reuse: true` in YAML.

**Reconciliation with "no background process" invariant:**
The invariant "No command starts a long-running background process" (§Invariants)
refers to user-visible daemons that require management (start/stop/monitor).
The reusable browser server is:
- Self-terminating (idle timeout)
- Not user-managed (no start/stop commands)
- Discoverable only via an ephemeral runtime file
- Semantically equivalent to a kernel page cache or credential helper

This is a permitted side-effect, not a background service.

### Module Resolution (v0.9.0+)

`quarry run` supports a `--resolve-from` flag for workspace and monorepo
setups where scripts import bare specifiers (`@myorg/db`, `shared-utils`)
that cannot be resolved from the script's directory.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--resolve-from` | string | | Path to `node_modules` directory for ESM resolution fallback |

| Environment Variable | Set by | Description |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| `QUARRY_RESOLVE_FROM` | Go runtime | Absolute path to the resolution fallback directory |

**Semantics:**
- The flag value must be an existing directory. It is absolutized at parse time.
- The Go runtime sets `QUARRY_RESOLVE_FROM` and prepends to `NODE_PATH` (CJS
  fallback) on the executor's environment.
- The Node executor registers an ESM resolve hook via `module.register()`.
  The hook tries default resolution first, then falls back to
  `createRequire(resolveFrom)` for bare specifiers only.
- Relative and absolute specifiers are never intercepted by the hook.
- Config file: `resolve_from: /app/node_modules` in YAML.

**Why `NODE_PATH` alone is insufficient:**
`NODE_PATH` only affects CJS `require()`. ESM `import` ignores it entirely.
The `module.register()` hook is the correct mechanism for ESM (stable since
Node 20.6+).

## `inspect` (single-entity introspection)

`inspect` commands return a deep view of a single entity and are read-only.
Data is sourced from the runtime’s read path (see CONTRACT_LODE.md).

### `inspect run <run-id>`

Request:
```
InspectRunRequest:
  run_id: string
```

Response:
```
InspectRunResponse:
  run_id: string
  job_id: string
  state: string
  attempt: number
  parent_run: string | null
  policy: string
  started_at: time
  ended_at: time | null
```

### `inspect job <job-id>`

Response must include:
- `job_id`
- `state`
- `run_ids` (if any)

### `inspect task <task-id>`

Response must include:
- `task_id`
- `state`
- `run_id` (if any)

### `inspect proxy <pool-name>`

Response:
```
InspectProxyPoolResponse:
  name: string
  strategy: string
  endpoint_cnt: number
  sticky: ProxySticky | null
  runtime:
    round_robin_index: number
    sticky_entries: number
    last_used_at: time | null
```

This response reinforces that **proxy selection is runtime-owned** and
the executor only applies resolved endpoints (see CONTRACT_PROXY.md).

### `inspect executor <executor-id>`

Response must include:
- `executor_id`
- `state`
- `last_seen_at` (time | null)

---

## `stats` (aggregated facts)

`stats` commands return aggregated, derived facts. They must not expose
internal counters from executors. Stats are derived from Lode.

### `stats runs`

Response:
```
RunStats:
  total: number
  running: number
  succeeded: number
  failed: number
```

### `stats proxies`

Response:
```
ProxyStats:
  pool: string
  requests: number
  failures: number
  last_used_at: time | null
```

### `stats jobs`

Response must include:
- `total`
- `running`
- `succeeded`
- `failed`

### `stats tasks`

Response must include:
- `total`
- `running`
- `succeeded`
- `failed`

### `stats executors`

Response must include:
- `total`
- `running`
- `idle`
- `failed`

### `stats metrics`

Returns the most recent metrics snapshot.

Optional flags:
- `--storage-dataset=<name>` — Lode dataset ID (default: `"quarry"`)
- `--storage-backend=fs|s3` — storage backend for Lode reads
- `--storage-path=<path>` — storage path (fs: directory, s3: bucket/prefix)
- `--storage-region=<region>` — AWS region for S3 backend
- `--run-id=<id>` — read metrics for a specific run
- `--source=<source>` — filter by source partition

Both `--storage-backend` and `--storage-path` must be provided together.
When provided, metrics are read from Lode storage. When omitted, stub
data is returned (see Data Source Progression in CONTRACT_METRICS.md).

Response:
```
MetricsSnapshot:
  ts: time
  run_id: string
  job_id: string | null
  policy: string
  executor: string
  storage_backend: string
  runs_started_total: number
  runs_completed_total: number
  runs_failed_total: number
  runs_crashed_total: number
  events_received_total: number
  events_persisted_total: number
  events_dropped_total: number
  dropped_by_type: map[string]number (optional)
  executor_launch_success_total: number
  executor_launch_failure_total: number
  executor_crash_total: number
  ipc_decode_errors_total: number
  lode_write_success_total: number
  lode_write_failure_total: number
  lode_write_retry_total: number
  flush_triggers: map[string]number (optional, streaming policy only)
```

Metric names match CONTRACT_METRICS.md. See CONTRACT_METRICS.md for the
outcome-to-metric mapping (which outcomes increment which counters).
Dimensions are included for traceability.

Usage examples:
```
quarry stats metrics --storage-backend fs --storage-path /data/quarry
quarry stats metrics --storage-backend fs --storage-path /data/quarry --run-id run-001
quarry stats metrics --storage-backend s3 --storage-path mybucket/quarry --storage-region us-west-2
quarry stats metrics --format json
```

---

## `list` (enumeration)

`list` commands return thin slices (not inspect-level detail).

### `list runs`

Supported filters:
- `--state=running|failed|succeeded`
- `--limit=<n>`

Response must include:
- `run_id`
- `state`
- `started_at`

### `list jobs`

Response must include:
- `job_id`
- `state`

### `list pools`

Response must include:
- `name`
- `strategy`

### `list executors`

Response must include:
- `executor_id`
- `state`

---

## `debug` (sharp tools, opt-in)

`debug` commands are opt-in diagnostic tools and **must not execute work**.
They are read-only by default. Any mutation must be:
- explicitly requested by a flag
- ephemeral and non-persistent
- non-executing (no runs affected or started)
- observable in logs and inspection surfaces
- limited to runtime mechanics (never datasets, runs, or policies)

### `debug resolve proxy <pool>`

Purpose:
- test selector logic
- validate configuration
- reason about rotation

Response:
```
ResolveProxyResponse:
  endpoint: ProxyEndpoint
  committed: boolean
```

The `committed` field indicates whether the resolution was committed (rotation
counters advanced). It is `false` by default and `true` only when `--commit`
is provided.

By default this command is read-only and **must not** mutate runtime state.

Optional flag:
- `--commit`

If `--commit` is provided, the runtime **may** advance in-memory rotation
counters. This mutation is:
- ephemeral
- non-persistent
- non-executing
- local to proxy selection mechanics

It must not write to Lode, change datasets, or affect runs or policies.
This is the only allowed mutation outside `run` and must be observable in
logs and inspection surfaces.

### `debug ipc`

Response:
```
IPCDebugResponse:
  transport: string
  encoding: string
  messages_sent: number
  errors: number
  last_error: string | null
```

No payload dumping unless `--verbose` is provided.

---

## `version`

`version` reports the canonical project version.
It must not contact the executor.

Response:
```
VersionResponse:
  version: string
  commit: string
```

### Lockstep Versioning

All Quarry components share a single canonical version defined in `types.Version`.
This includes:
- CLI version
- Emit contract version (CONTRACT_EMIT.md)
- IPC contract version (CONTRACT_IPC.md)

Version changes require updating the single source constant. There is no separate
"contract version" — the project version is the contract version.
