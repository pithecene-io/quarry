# Quarry Emit Contract

This document freezes the **emit contract** between user scripts and the Quarry
runtime boundary. It defines the **event envelope**, **event types**, **ordering**,
**versioning**, and **error semantics**.

This is a contract document. Implementations must conform.

---

## Scope

- Applies to all events emitted by user scripts via `emit.*`.
- Applies to sidecar file uploads via `storage.put()`.
- Defines an envelope that must wrap every event.
- Defines initial event types and their invariants.
- Defines ordering guarantees per run.
- Defines error semantics across script, executor, and policy failures.

Non-goals:
- Does not define storage layouts or ingestion policy behavior.
- Does not define IPC framing (see CONTRACT_IPC.md).

---

## Envelope

Every event is a single **envelope object** with the following fields.
All fields are required unless marked optional.

- `contract_version` (string)
  - Semantic version string for this contract.
  - Must be present in every event.
- `event_id` (string)
  - Unique ID for the event.
  - Uniqueness is scoped to a run (see CONTRACT_RUN.md).
- `run_id` (string)
  - Canonical run identifier.
- `seq` (integer)
  - Monotonic sequence number per run.
  - Starts at 1 for each run.
- `type` (string)
  - One of the defined event types below.
- `ts` (string)
  - Event timestamp in ISO 8601 UTC.
- `payload` (object)
  - Type-specific payload.
- `job_id` (string, optional)
  - Included when known at emit-time.
- `parent_run_id` (string, optional)
  - Included when the run is a retry or child run.
- `attempt` (integer)
  - Attempt number. Always present. Starts at 1 for initial runs.

The envelope must be **stable** and **parseable without schema discovery**.

## Event Types

### 1) `item`
Represents a durable, structured output record.

Required payload fields:
- `item_type` (string) — caller-defined type label
- `data` (object) — the record payload

### 2) `artifact`
Represents a binary or large payload.

Required payload fields:
- `artifact_id` (string)
- `name` (string)
- `content_type` (string)
- `size_bytes` (integer)

The **artifact event is the commit record** for an artifact. Artifact bytes
may be transmitted before this event (see CONTRACT_IPC.md for ordering,
chunking, and `is_last` signaling).

Orphaned bytes (no corresponding artifact event) are eligible for GC.

### 3) `checkpoint`
Represents an explicit script checkpoint.

Required payload fields:
- `checkpoint_id` (string)
- `note` (string, optional)

### 4) `enqueue` (optional advisory)
Suggests the runtime consider enqueueing additional work.

Required payload fields:
- `target` (string)
- `params` (object)

Optional payload fields (v0.6.2+):
- `source` (string) — override the child run's source partition key (default: inherit from root)
- `category` (string) — override the child run's category partition key (default: inherit from root)

Semantics:
- Advisory only; not guaranteed or required.
- No feedback channel is implied.
- `source` and `category` are partition hints only. They do not affect dedup
  (dedup is by `(target, params)` only).

Runtime interpretation (v0.6.0+):
- Default (`--depth 0`): advisory only, as above.
- With `--depth > 0`: runtime schedules and executes as child runs.
  Deduplication and depth limits are applied by the fan-out operator.
  The contract itself is unchanged; runtime behavior depends on CLI flags.

### 5) `rotate_proxy` (optional advisory)
Suggests the runtime consider rotating proxy/session identity.

Required payload fields:
- `reason` (string, optional)

Semantics:
- Advisory only; not guaranteed or required.

### 6) `log`
Structured log event emitted by script.

Required payload fields:
- `level` (string) — `debug|info|warn|error`
- `message` (string)
- `fields` (object, optional)

### 7) `run_error`
Represents a script-level error that should terminate the run.

Required payload fields:
- `error_type` (string)
- `message` (string)
- `stack` (string, optional)

### 8) `run_complete`
Represents normal completion of the script.

Required payload fields:
- `summary` (object, optional)

#### Reserved summary fields (v0.9.0+)

When the `prepare` hook returns `{ action: 'skip' }`, the executor emits
`run_complete` with the following reserved fields in `summary`:

- `skipped` (boolean) — `true` when the run was skipped by `prepare`
- `reason` (string, optional) — skip reason provided by the hook

Scripts should not use `skipped` or `reason` as summary keys for other
purposes. These fields are set by the executor, not by user code.

---

## Storage API (`storage.put()`)

Scripts may write sidecar files via `storage.put()`. These files bypass
the event envelope, sequence numbering, and policy pipeline entirely.

### Semantics

- `storage.put()` shares the same serialization chain as `emit.*` for
  ordering and fail-fast behavior.
- **Terminal boundary**: calling `storage.put()` after a terminal event
  (`run_complete` or `run_error`) throws `TerminalEventError`.
- **Not events**: file writes do not produce event envelopes and are
  not counted in `seq`.
- Files are transported as `file_write` IPC frames (see CONTRACT_IPC.md).

### Filename Rules

- Must not be empty.
- Must not contain path separators (`/` or `\`).
- Must not contain `..`.

### Content Type

- Caller provides a `content_type` (MIME type) with each file.
- Content type is persisted as a companion `.meta.json` sidecar file
  alongside the data file in storage.

---

## Ordering Guarantees

- **Total order per run** is guaranteed.
- The runtime must observe events in strictly increasing `seq`.
- No reordering across event types is permitted.
- The contract does not specify ordering across different runs.

---

## Versioning Rules

- The envelope includes `contract_version`.
- Contract changes must be **backward-compatible additive**.
  - New fields are allowed if optional.
  - New event types are allowed if optional for consumers.
- Removing fields or changing semantics is a **breaking change** and forbidden in 0.x.

---

## Error Semantics

Errors are classified by **origin** and **impact**.

### Script Abort (Emit `run_error`)
- The script detects a fatal error and emits `run_error`.
- The script **should** terminate shortly after.
- The runtime records the run as failed, with the error payload.

### Executor Crash (No `run_error`)
- The executor process exits unexpectedly.
- The runtime records a **crash** outcome.
- Any partial stream is considered incomplete.

### Policy Failure
- The ingestion policy fails to accept events.
- The runtime records a **policy failure** outcome.
- The script may still be running, but the run is terminated by the runtime.

In all cases, a failed run must be distinguishable by downstream consumers using
run metadata (see CONTRACT_RUN.md).
