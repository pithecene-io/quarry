**Web extraction runtime for browser-driven crawling and durable ingestion**

Quarry is a browser-backed web extraction runtime designed for imperative Puppeteer scripts, adversarial sites, and long-lived ETL pipelines. It executes bespoke extraction logic under a disciplined runtime contract, streams observations incrementally, and leaves durability and recovery to the underlying persistence layer.
