## [Unreleased]

_No unreleased changes._

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **SDK**: `prepare` lifecycle hook — transform or filter job payloads before browser launch; return `{ action: 'skip' }` to short-circuit a run without acquiring a browser (#175)
- **SDK**: `beforeTerminal` lifecycle hook — outcome-aware hook that fires after script execution but before the terminal event, with emit still open; useful for emitting summary items or final metadata (#175)
- **SDK**: `PrepareResult`, `PrepareHook`, `TerminalSignal`, `BeforeTerminalHook` type exports (#175)
- **Executor**: Malformed `prepare` return validation — null, undefined, non-object, or missing `action` returns produce a diagnostic crash instead of an unhandled TypeError (#175)
- **Docs**: Lifecycle hooks documented in PUBLIC_API.md, run guide, and emit guide (#175)
- **Docs**: `CONTRACT_RUN.md` updated with lifecycle hook execution model and `prepare`-skip early return semantics
- **Docs**: `CONTRACT_EMIT.md` updated with `skipped` and `reason` fields on `run_complete` summary
- **Examples**: `hooks-prepare` and `hooks-before-terminal` runnable examples (#175)
- **Testing**: 24 new executor tests and 7 loader validation tests for lifecycle hooks (#175)

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **SDK**: `createBatcher` utility for batching `emit.enqueue()` calls — accumulates items and emits fewer, larger enqueue events with `params.items`, reducing child run count for high fan-out workloads (#170)

### Changed

- **Container**: Go module layer split and multi-stage cache mounts for faster image builds (#167)
- **CI**: Container build added to release dry-run workflow (#168)

---

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-12

### Changed

- **Lode**: Upgrade Lode storage library to v0.7.3

### Fixed

- **IPC**: Eliminate stdout guard proxy to fix drain deadlock — `Object.create(process.stdout)` caused `_events` divergence after listener cleanup, silently breaking drain delivery and hanging the executor under backpressure; replaced with split contract (separate stream + writeFn) (#164)

### Added

- **IPC**: Backpressure integration test that deterministically proves drain path is exercised — spawns child, withholds parent reads until pipe fills, asserts `backpressure_events > 0` (#164)
- **AGENTS.md**: Stream & EventEmitter discipline guardrail — bans `Object.create()` on EventEmitter instances, requires composition over prototype delegation (#164)

---

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-11

### Changed

- **Container**: Full image uses Chrome for Testing tarball instead of distro Chromium — pins browser version to puppeteer compatibility matrix (#159)
- **Container**: Full image is now **amd64-only** — Chrome for Testing does not publish linux-arm64 builds; arm64 users should use the slim image with an external browser sidecar (#159)

### Fixed

- **IPC**: Protect IPC channel from stray stdout writes — third-party code (puppeteer-extra, stealth plugin) writing to `process.stdout` caused the Go `FrameDecoder` to interpret text as a length prefix, deriving huge payload sizes and blocking indefinitely; stdout guard now captures the real `write` for IPC and redirects stray writes to stderr with a diagnostic warning (#161)
- **Container**: Retain `ca-certificates` in full runtime image — previous purge of build-time download tools accidentally removed the TLS trust store, breaking HTTPS at runtime (#160)
- **Container**: Add `libasound2` to Chrome shared-library set — missing ALSA dependency could cause Chrome to fail at dynamic link time (#160)
- **Container**: Fail fast when building full image on non-amd64 — prevents silent production of images with a wrong-architecture Chrome binary (#160)

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Distribution**: Containerized distribution via GHCR — `ghcr.io/pithecene-io/quarry:0.7.1` (full, with system Chromium + fonts) and `ghcr.io/pithecene-io/quarry:0.7.1-slim` (no browser, BYO Chromium via `--browser-ws-endpoint`) (#152)
- **CI**: Dockerfile lint check (`docker build --check`) in PR and main CI workflows (#152)
- **Testing**: Integration test for terminal frame visibility at pipe boundary — pins the stdout flush race that caused false `executor_crash` classification (#153)

### Fixed

- **Executor**: Drain stdout before `process.exit()` to prevent false `executor_crash` — `process.exit()` was discarding buffered stdout data before it reached the OS pipe, causing the Go runtime to see EOF without a terminal event and classify successful runs as `executor_crash` (#153)

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Runtime**: Transparent browser reuse across `quarry run` invocations — Chromium persists as a detached process and auto-terminates after idle timeout, eliminating cold-start cost for sequential runs (#149)
- **CLI**: `--no-browser-reuse` flag and `no_browser_reuse` config option to disable transparent browser reuse (#149)
- **Runtime**: `QUARRY_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT` environment variable for configuring browser server idle timeout (default 60s) (#149)
- **Executor**: `--browser-server` mode — self-managing browser server with idle monitoring via `/json/list` polling and graceful shutdown (#149)
- **Policy**: `streaming` ingestion policy — combines strict's no-drop guarantee with buffered's batched write efficiency for long-running crawl workloads (#140)
- **Policy**: Configurable flush triggers: `--flush-count` (event count threshold) and `--flush-interval` (time-based periodic flush) (#140)
- **Policy**: Capacity-triggered emergency flush prevents deadlock when internal buffer bounds are reached before configured triggers fire (#140)
- **Policy**: Backpressure-based flow control — ingestion blocks when buffer is full rather than dropping events (#140)
- **Proxy**: `recency_window` pool option — maintains a ring buffer of recently-used endpoint indices and excludes them from random selection, reducing endpoint reuse (#143)
- **Proxy**: LRU fallback when recency window >= endpoint count (selection never blocks) (#143)
- **Testing**: E2E browser reuse tests gated behind `-e2e` flag for mutual test exclusivity (#149)
- **Testing**: Performance benchmarks for all ingestion policies (strict, buffered, streaming) with contention analysis (#144)
- **Infra**: yamllint added to lint pipeline via project-scoped mise (#149)
- **Docs**: Streaming policy contract section in CONTRACT_POLICY.md (#139)

### Changed

- **Metrics**: `flush_triggers` counter added to metrics snapshot — per-trigger-type flush counts (`count`, `interval`, `termination`, `capacity`) for streaming policy observability (#140)
- **Internal**: `statsRecorder` converted from mutex-based to `sync/atomic` counters — 3.7x improvement in 8-goroutine contention benchmarks (#144)
- **AGENTS.md**: Release checklist expanded with changelog promotion and golden fixture update steps (#148)

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Runtime**: SDK/CLI version mismatches are now classified as `version_mismatch` instead of `executor_crash`, with an actionable error message directing users to align their SDK and CLI versions (#132)
- **Lode**: Upgraded to Lode v0.7.1 — fixes O(n²) flush performance caused by linear snapshot ID lookups in `dataset.Write()` (pithecene-io/lode#108)

### Changed

- **Runtime**: Version mismatch errors increment `run_failed` (not `run_crashed`) and do not fire `executor_crash` metric (#132)
- **CLI**: `version_mismatch` outcome maps to exit code 3 (non-retryable, same as `policy_failure`) (#132)
- **Contracts**: `CONTRACT_RUN.md` and `CONTRACT_INTEGRATION.md` now enumerate `version_mismatch` as a fifth outcome status (#132)
- **Infra**: Migrated npm/JSR scope from `@justapithecus` to `@pithecene-io` (#137)
- **Infra**: Migrated Go module path from `github.com/justapithecus/quarry` to `github.com/pithecene-io/quarry` (#137)
- **Lode**: Upgraded to Lode v0.7.2 (`github.com/pithecene-io/lode`) (#137)

---

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **CLI**: `--browser-ws-endpoint` flag — connect to an externally managed browser instead of launching Chromium per run, eliminating ~180x cold-start overhead for multi-run workloads (#127)
- **Emit**: Per-enqueue `source` and `category` partition overrides — child runs can target different Lode partitions via `emit.enqueue({ source, category })` (#129)
- **Docs**: Browser reuse documented in CLI guide, configuration reference, and PUBLIC_API.md (#130)
- **Docs**: Enqueue partition overrides documented in CONTRACT_EMIT.md and emit guide (#130)

### Changed

- **Runtime**: `storage.put()` now **fails fast** when FileWriter is not configured — previously logged a warning and silently discarded data (#128)
- **Runtime**: Metrics persistence timeout increased from 10s to 30s to match policy flush timeout (#128)
- **Docs**: Fan-out support level downgraded from `Supported` to `Experimental` in SUPPORT.md (#130)

### Upgrade Notes

- **Breaking**: `storage.put()` now returns an error instead of silently discarding data when storage is not configured. Scripts using `storage.put()` must ensure `--storage-backend` and `--storage-path` are set. Previously, misconfigured runs would silently lose sidecar files.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Runtime**: Fan-out operator for derived work execution — `emit.enqueue()` events now trigger child runs at runtime, enabling discovery-driven extraction chains (list → detail → asset) without external orchestrators (#117)
- **CLI**: `--depth` flag to set maximum fan-out recursion depth (root = depth 0); required for fan-out activation (#117)
- **CLI**: `--max-runs` flag to cap total child runs (required when `--depth > 0` as a safety rail against unbounded fan-out) (#117)
- **CLI**: `--parallel` flag to control concurrent child run execution (default: 1, sequential) (#117)
- **Docs**: Derived work execution design replacing crawl mode concept (#116)
- **Docs**: Ingress models exploration document (#115)
- **Docs**: Temporal orchestration integration and module split documentation (#114)

### Changed

- **Lode**: Decoupled Lode from `cli/reader` dependency — cleaner module boundaries (#113)

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Release**: Published npm packages on GitHub Packages now include `dist/` directory — previous releases (v0.4.1, v0.5.0) shipped empty tarballs with no type declarations or runtime code (#110, #111)

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Adapter**: Redis pub/sub adapter — publishes `RunCompletedEvent` as JSON to a configurable Redis channel after run completion (#107)
- **Adapter**: `--adapter-channel` CLI flag for Redis pub/sub channel name (default: `quarry:run_completed`) (#107)
- **Adapter**: Redis adapter config in YAML: `adapter.channel` field (#107)
- **Adapter**: Webhook adapter — HTTP POST with retries, custom headers, timeout (#103)
- **Adapter**: `Adapter` interface and `RunCompletedEvent` type in `quarry/adapter/` (#103)
- **Adapter**: CLI flags: `--adapter`, `--adapter-url`, `--adapter-header`, `--adapter-timeout`, `--adapter-retries` (#103)
- **Contracts**: CONTRACT_INTEGRATION.md updated with runtime adapter reference, Redis and webhook (#103, #107)

- **Docs**: Integration guide updated with webhook and Redis adapter examples (#103, #107)
- **Docs**: Configuration guide updated with adapter section (#107)

### Changed

- **Docs**: CLI_PARITY.json updated with adapter flags and validation (#103, #107)

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Config**: `--config` flag for YAML project-level defaults — reduces CLI flag repetition across invocations (#104)
- **Config**: `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` environment variable expansion in YAML config files (#104)
- **Config**: Inline proxy pool definitions via `proxies:` key in YAML config, replacing deprecated `--proxy-config` JSON file (#104)
- **Config**: Unknown YAML keys rejected via `KnownFields(true)` to catch typos early (#104)
- **Testing**: Hardened config edge cases — env expansion boundaries, whitespace/comments-only YAML, Duration validation, retries nil vs zero

### Changed

- **CLI**: `--source`, `--storage-backend`, `--storage-path` no longer require CLI flags when provided via `--config` file (#104)
- **CLI**: `--proxy-config` deprecated in favor of `proxies:` key in YAML config (#104)
- **Docs**: Removed premature adapter schema from configuration guide
- **Docs**: Clarified proxy job-level selection as CLI flags, not YAML config keys

### Fixed

- **Runtime**: Adapter config in YAML now emits a warning instead of being silently ignored

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-07

### Changed

- **Lode**: Extracted shared `newClient()` constructor helper to prevent future initialization drift between FS and S3 client paths (#92)

### Added

- **Testing**: Regression test `TestNewClient_InitializesMaps` guards against nil-map constructor bugs (#92)

  - Stealth enabled by default (`QUARRY_STEALTH=0` to disable)
  - Adblocker opt-in via `QUARRY_ADBLOCKER=1`
  - No-sandbox mode for CI via `QUARRY_NO_SANDBOX=1`
- **Docs**: Consolidated configuration reference (`docs/guides/configuration.md`) (#81)

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Metrics**: Runtime metrics surface per CONTRACT_METRICS.md — run lifecycle, ingestion drops, executor failures, storage write counters (#65)
- **Metrics**: Persist metrics snapshot to Lode at run end as `record_kind=metrics` record (#67)
- **CLI**: `stats metrics` subcommand with Lode-backed reader for querying persisted metrics (#68)

- **Docs**: Phase 6 (dogfooding) clarified as post-release validation exercise (#70)
- **Docs**: v0.3.0 deliverables reworded — dogfooding is a prerequisite, not a gate (#70)

### Fixed

- **Go**: Prefer `errors.New` over `fmt.Errorf` for static error strings (#69)

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- **CI**: Fixed GitHub Packages publish auth failure (ENEEDAUTH) in release workflow. Root cause was missing `actions/setup-node` with registry configuration. Fix adds `packages: write` permission, proper registry-url setup, and `publishConfig` in SDK package.json.
- **CI**: Enforced pinned pnpm via Corepack in publish workflow. Replaced global `npm install -g pnpm` with Corepack-based setup that reads `packageManager` from root package.json. Added version verification step that fails fast on mismatch.

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- **IPC**: Fixed race condition where fast-completing scripts intermittently reported `executor_crash` outcome despite successful completion ([#56](https://github.com/pithecene-io/quarry/issues/56)). Root cause was Go's `exec.Cmd.Wait()` closing stdout pipe before ingestion completed reading all data.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **CLI**: `--job-json <path>` flag to load job payload from file (alternative to inline `--job`)
- **Docs**: Downstream integration guide with event-bus and polling patterns
- **CI**: CLI/config parity checker validates flag documentation against implementation
- **CI**: Strict parity gate blocks merge on CLI documentation drift
- **Examples**: Integration pattern examples (SNS, handler, filesystem polling, S3 polling)

### Changed

- **CLI**: `--job` description clarified as "inline JSON object" to distinguish from `--job-json`
- **CLI**: Job payload (`--job` and `--job-json`) now **requires** a top-level JSON object; arrays, primitives, and null are rejected with actionable error messages
- **CLI**: Normalized help text for job, storage, and policy flags for consistency
- **Docs**: CLI parity artifact (`docs/CLI_PARITY.json`) added as machine-checkable source of truth

### Known Issues

- **IPC race condition** ([#56](https://github.com/pithecene-io/quarry/issues/56)): Fast-completing scripts may intermittently report `executor_crash` outcome despite successful completion. **Fixed in v0.2.1.**

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- **CLI**: `quarry run` command for executing extraction scripts
- **CLI**: `quarry inspect` command for viewing run data (read-only)
- **CLI**: `quarry stats` command for run statistics
- **SDK**: `@pithecene-io/quarry-sdk` npm package with emit API
- **Emit API**: `emit.item()`, `emit.artifact()`, `emit.checkpoint()`, `emit.log()`
- **Terminal events**: `emit.runComplete()`, `emit.runError()`
- **Storage**: Filesystem backend with Hive-partitioned layout
- **Storage**: S3 backend (experimental, requires explicit opt-in)
- **Policies**: Strict and Buffered ingestion policies
- **Proxy**: Runtime proxy configuration and rotation support
- **Executor**: Embedded Node.js executor in Go binary (~28MB)
- **Contracts**: IPC, Emit, Run, Policy, Lode, CLI, Proxy contracts frozen

### Changed

- N/A (initial release)

### Fixed

- N/A (initial release)

### Breaking Changes

- None (initial release)

### Known Limitations

1. **Single executor type**: Only Node.js executor supported
2. **No built-in retries**: Retry logic is caller's responsibility
3. **No streaming reads**: Artifacts must fit in memory
4. **S3 is experimental**: No transactional guarantees across writes
5. **No job scheduling**: Quarry is an execution runtime, not a scheduler
6. **Puppeteer required**: All scripts run in a browser context

### Upgrade Notes

**Runtime Requirements:**
- Go 1.25.6 or later (for building from source)
- Node.js 23+ or 22.6+ (for script execution; 22.6 requires `--experimental-strip-types`)
- pnpm 10.28.2 (for development)

**Puppeteer:**
- Puppeteer is a peer dependency; install it in your project:
  ```bash
  npm install puppeteer
  ```

**Storage:**
- `--storage-backend` and `--storage-path` are required flags
- FS backend path must exist before running
