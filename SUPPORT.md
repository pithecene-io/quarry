## What Is Not Supported

### Explicit Non-Goals

- **Job scheduling**: Quarry is an execution runtime, not a scheduler
- **Automatic retries**: Retry logic is the caller's responsibility
- **Streaming reads**: Artifacts must fit in memory
- **Headless-only mode**: Scripts require Puppeteer (browser context)
- **Alternative executors**: Only Node.js executor is supported

### Experimental Features

The following are available but not production-hardened:

- **Proxy rotation**: Advisory only; actual rotation depends on infrastructure

---

## Bug Reports

Report bugs via GitHub Issues:
- https://github.com/pithecene-io/quarry/issues

### Issue Template

When reporting issues, include:

1. **Quarry version**: Output of `quarry version`
2. **Environment**: OS, Node version, Go version
3. **Reproduction steps**: Minimal script and command
4. **Expected behavior**: What should happen
5. **Actual behavior**: What happens instead
6. **Logs**: Relevant error output (sanitize credentials)

## Issue Severity

| Severity | Description | Response |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| P0 (Critical) | Data loss, security issue | Hotfix release |
| P1 (High) | Core functionality broken | Next minor release |
| P2 (Medium) | Non-critical bug | Backlog |
| P3 (Low) | Enhancement request | Backlog |

---

## Security

Report security vulnerabilities privately:
- Email: security@pithecene-io.com (if applicable)
- Do **not** file security issues publicly

---

## Deprecation Policy

- Deprecated features are documented in release notes
- Deprecated features remain functional for at least one minor version
- Removed features are documented in the changelog

---

## Version Compatibility

Quarry uses lockstep versioning:
- SDK version must match runtime version
- Mismatched versions produce a contract version error

Check versions:
```bash
quarry version
# 0.7.0 (commit: ...)
```
